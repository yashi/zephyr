    Connectivity chip that uses Infineon Bluetooth Host Controller Interface UART
    driver.

    Example of enabling device:

      &uart2 {
        status = "okay";
        current-speed = <115200>;

        /* HCI-UART pins*/
        pinctrl-0 = <&p3_1_scb2_uart_tx &p3_0_scb2_uart_rx
                     &p3_2_scb2_uart_rts &p3_3_scb2_uart_cts>;
        pinctrl-names = "default";

        /* HW Flow control must be enabled for HCI H4 */
        hw-flow-control;

        bt_hci_uart: bt_hci_uart {
          compatible = "zephyr,bt-hci-uart";
          status = "okay";

          bt-hci {
            status = "okay";
            compatible = "infineon,bt-hci-uart";
            bt-reg-on-gpios = <&gpio_prt3 4 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;

            fw-download-speed = <3000000>;
          };
        };
      };

    NOTE1: The UART bus speed (current_speed) for bt_hci_uart should be the same
           as the default baudrate defined in controller firmware (default 115200).

    NOTE2: Use fw-download-speed and hci-operation-speed properties to configure UART
           speeds for firmware download (fw-download-speed) and HCI operation
           (hci-operation-speed).
           If hci-operation-speed or fw-download-speed are not defined in bt-hci node,
           bt-hci driver will use bus/current-speed as default speed.

    NOTE3: Requires fetch binary files of BT controller. To fetch binary blobs:
           west blobs fetch hal_infineon
