      FDCAN kernel/domain clock divider. The resulting clock is fed to the FDCAN time quanta
      clock. Note that the divisor is common to all 'st,stm32h7-fdcan' instances.

      The clock divider, which is set via the FDCAN_CCU->CCFG_CDIV register, defaults to divide by 1
      unless this property is provided.
